Spam - emails

Email spam, also known as junk email, is unsolicited bulk messages sent through email. The use of spam has been growing in popularity since the early 1990s and is a problem faced by most email users.In recent times, unwanted commercial bulk emails called spam has become a huge problem on the internet. 

## Overview

The project aims to classify spam and ham emails by including various real-time features into account with the help of advanced supervised learning algorithms such as SVM and Logistic Regression.

The upsurge in the volume of unwanted emails called spam has created an intense need for the development of more dependable and robust antispam filters. Machine learning methods of recent are being used to successfully detect  spam emails.


## Support Vector Machine(SVM):

Support vector machines (SVMs) are powerful yet flexible supervised machine learning algorithms which are used both for classification and regression. But generally, they are used in classification problems.

The goal of SVM is to identify an optimal separating hyperplane which maximizes the margin between different classes of the training data.It is really effective in higher dimension. If you have more features than training examples, most of the algorithms perform very bad, but SVM is the only algorithm which can saves you in this situation.
Best algorithm if you data are separable.In Python, scikit-learn is a widely used library for implementing machine learning algorithms.
Only support vectors affect the optimally spaced hyperplane. So, it is less affected by outliers.

## Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is a statistical model that in its basic form uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable, although many more complex extensions exist. Logistic Regression uses a different method for estimating the parameters, which gives better resultsâ€“better meaning unbiased, with lower variances.
